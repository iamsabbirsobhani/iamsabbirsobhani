# Hey there!üëãüèº 

I'm Sobhani, an independent software engineer who loves to create and share useful content about computer science and the web. When I'm not writing code (which is rare because I have no life whatsoever!), you'll find me reading books, exploring new things, and listening to music.

```javascript
const meNskills = {
   name: "Sabbir Sobhani",
   pronouns: "he" | "him",
   code: ["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Node.js", "Python"],
   technologies: {
      frontEnd: {
         language: ["JavaScript, "TypeScript"],
         framework: ["Vue.js", "Nuxt.js", "React.js", "Next.js"],
         style: ["CSS", "SCSS", "TailwindCSS", "Bootstrap"]
      },
      backEnd: {
         language: ["Node.js(JS, TS), "Python", "Java"],
         framework: ["Express.js", "Flask", "Django", "Spring Boot"]
      },
      databases: ["SQL", "PostgreSQL", "Oracle", "MySQL", "NoSQL", "MongoDB"],
