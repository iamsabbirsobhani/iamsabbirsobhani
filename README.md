# Hey there!üëãüèº 

I'm Sobhani, an independent software engineer who loves to create and share useful content about computer science and the web. When I'm not writing code (which is rare because I have no life whatsoever!), you'll find me reading books, exploring new things, and listening to music.

const meNskills = {
